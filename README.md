🏀 Ganiyu’s NBA Betting Intelligence System
📌 Overview

An automated Python-based system that analyzes NBA player props, spreads, and moneylines to identify positive expected-value (+EV) betting opportunities by comparing statistical predictions against sportsbook lines.

🧱 System Architecture
1️⃣ Data Collection Module

Purpose: Automatically gathers all data sources used by the analysis pipeline.

Sub-components

Player Stats Scraper – game logs, season stats, advanced metrics

Team Stats Scraper – pace, ratings, recent form

Injury Report Scraper – daily player updates

Odds Scraper – current betting lines from multiple sportsbooks

Historical Data Importer – one-time import of past-season data

Data Sources

NBA Stats API (official, reliable)

Basketball-Reference (historical backup)

The Odds API (betting lines, 500 free requests/mo)

ESPN (injury reports)

Design Decisions

Run scrapers daily before games start

Store raw → clean later (preserve source data)

Include robust error handling for downtime

2️⃣ Data Storage (Database)

Purpose: Organize all collected data for fast querying and historical analysis.

Choice: SQLite (simple, file-based, upgradable to PostgreSQL later)

Schema Overview

Table	Purpose
players	Player metadata
games	Game schedule & results
player_game_stats	Individual player box scores
team_stats	Team-level ratings & pace
injuries	Daily player status
betting_lines	Sportsbook odds
predictions	Model forecasts
bet_tracking	Real-world results & ROI tracking
3️⃣ Analysis & Prediction Engine

The core brain that transforms data into predictions.

Stage 1 – Baseline Statistical Model (Weeks 1–4)

Rolling averages (5/10/15 games)

Season & split stats (home/away, opponent)

Pace & rest adjustments

Example Formula

PredictedPoints = BaseAvg * PaceAdj * RestAdj * HomeAwayAdj * OppDefAdj

Stage 2 – Machine Learning Model (Weeks 5–8)

Features: 50 + variables (usage rate, recent form, etc.)

Algorithms: Linear Regression → Random Forest → XGBoost

Cross-validation for robustness

Stage 3 – Advanced Model (Weeks 9–12)

Lineup-based projections

Minutes forecasting under injuries

Line movement & correlation analysis

Design Notes

Version each model (v1.0, v1.1, …)

Track prediction source version

A/B-test competing models

4️⃣ Odds Comparison Module

Goal: Identify +EV bets by comparing our predictions vs sportsbook lines.

Workflow

Pull daily sportsbook lines

Convert odds → implied probabilities

Compare with model probabilities

Compute Expected Value (EV)

Filter for EV ≥ 5% threshold

Rank by EV & confidence

Example Output

LeBron James – Over 25.5 Pts
Sportsbook: DraftKings @ –110 (52.4% implied)
Model Prob: 62% Edge: +9.6% EV
Kelly Bet Size: 3.2% bankroll Confidence: HIGH

5️⃣ User Dashboard / Interface

Two implementation paths:

Option	Description
A. CLI	Simple Python script output
B. Web Dashboard	Interactive browser UI with tables, charts, filters

Recommended: start CLI → upgrade to web later.

🗓 Development Roadmap
Phase	Timeline	Focus	Deliverable
1 – Foundation	Weeks 1–2	Setup env, build DB, import data	Populated DB
2 – Basic Analytics	Weeks 3–4	Rolling averages, v1 stats model	Baseline accuracy
3 – Automation	Weeks 5–6	Injury + odds scrapers, EV calc	Daily predictions
4 – Machine Learning	Weeks 7–10	Feature engineering, ML training	v2 ML model

📈 Kelly Criterion Explained

Formula

Bet Size % = (Edge) / (Decimal Odds)


Example:

Odds = –110 → 52.4 % implied

Model = 62 % → Edge = 9.6 %

Decimal Odds = 1.91

Kelly % = 0.096 / 1.91 ≈ 5 % of bankroll

Fractional Kelly (safer)

Kelly Fraction	Example Bet
100 %	5 % bankroll
50 %	2.5 %
25 %	1.25 %

✅ Most pros use 25–50 % Kelly to reduce variance.

🧮 Example Session
Player	Prop	Model	Book	Edge	Kelly %	½ Kelly Bet
LeBron	Over 25.5 pts	62 %	52.4 % (–110)	9.6 %	5 %	$50
Curry	Over 4.5 3PT	58 %	50 % (–110)	8 %	4.2 %	$42
Giannis	Over 11.5 reb	55 %	52.4 % (–110)	2.6 %	1.4 %	$14

Higher edge → larger bet; total risk ≈ 5 % of bankroll.

🚫 When Not to Bet

Skip any edge < 5 %; it’s likely noise vs true advantage.

🧠 System Output Example
===========================
TONIGHT’S RECOMMENDED BETS
Bankroll $2000 | Kelly 50 %
Min Edge 5 %
===========================

1. LeBron James – Over 25.5 Pts  
  Odds –110 | Model 62 % | Edge +9.6 %  
  → BET $50 (2.5 % bankroll) | EV +$4.80

2. Stephen Curry – Over 4.5 3PT  
  Odds –110 | Model 58 % | Edge +8.0 %  
  → BET $42 (2.1 % bankroll) | EV +$3.36

🧩 Key Takeaways

Kelly Criterion = mathematical bet sizing

Fractional Kelly reduces volatility

Bigger edge ⇒ bigger bet

Model tracking & bankroll management = long-term profitability
