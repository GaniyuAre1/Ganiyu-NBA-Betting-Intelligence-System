    "(feeds data to below)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Automatically gathers all the data we need\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-components:**\n",
    "- **Player Stats Scraper** - Gets game logs, season stats, advanced metrics\n",
    "- **Team Stats Scraper** - Pace, ratings, recent form\n",
    "- **Injury Report Scraper** - Daily injury updates\n",
    "- **Odds Scraper** - Current betting lines from sportsbooks\n",
    "- **Historical Data Importer** - One-time import of last season's data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sources We'll Use:**\n",
    "- NBA Stats API (official, free, reliable)\n",
    "- Basketball-Reference (backup for historical data)\n",
    "- The Odds API (betting lines - 500 free requests/month)\n",
    "- ESPN (injury reports)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Design Decision:**\n",
    "- We'll run scrapers **daily at a scheduled time** (before games start)\n",
    "- We'll store raw data first, clean it second (never lose original data)\n",
    "- We'll implement error handling (what if a website is down?)\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Stage 1: Simple Statistical Model (Weeks 1-4)**\n",
    "- Rolling averages (last 5, 10, 15 games)\n",
    "- Season averages\n",
    "- Home/away splits\n",
    "- Opponent adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Logic for Points Prediction:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Base = Player's last 10 game average\n",
    "Pace Adjustment = (Tonight's opponent pace / League average pace)\n",
    "Rest Adjustment = (Back-to-back? -5% | 2+ days rest? +2%)\n",
    "Home/Away = (Home: +2% | Away: -2%)\n",
    "Opponent Defense = (Top 10 defense? -8% | Bottom 10? +8%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicted Points = Base × Pace × Rest × Home × Opponent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stage 2: Machine Learning Model (Weeks 5-8)**\n",
    "- Train models on historical data\n",
    "- Features: 50+ variables (recent form, matchups, usage rate, etc.)\n",
    "- Algorithms: Linear Regression → Random Forest → XGBoost\n",
    "- Cross-validation to prevent overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stage 3: Advanced Model (Weeks 9-12)**\n",
    "- Lineup-based predictions (who's on court together)\n",
    "- Minutes projection (if starter is out, bench player gets more)\n",
    "- Line movement analysis (track how lines move = sharp money)\n",
    "- Correlation bets (if Player A goes over, Player B likely goes under)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Design Decision:**\n",
    "- We'll version our models (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)\n",

    "- A/B test different models against each other\n",

    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Compares our predictions to sportsbook lines and calculates EV\n",

    "**Process:**\n",
    "1. Get today's betting lines from multiple sportsbooks\n",
    "2. Convert odds to implied probability\n",

    "Bet Size % = (Your Edge) / (Decimal Odds)\n",

    "Let's use a real example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: LeBron James Over 25.5 Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Find Your Edge**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sportsbook offers **-110 odds** on Over 25.5 points.\n",
    "- This means bet $110 to win $100\n",
    "- Implied probability = 110/(110+100) = **52.4%**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model predicts LeBron goes over 25.5 points **62% of the time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Edge = 62% - 52.4% = 9.6%** (or 0.096 as a decimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Convert American Odds to Decimal Odds**\n",
    "\n",
    "American odds of **-110** = decimal odds of **1.91**\n",
    "\n",
    "How? For negative odds: Decimal = 1 + (100/110) = 1.91\n",
    "\n",
    "This means: For every $1 you bet, you get back $1.91 if you win (your $1 plus $0.91 profit)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Apply Kelly Formula**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Kelly Bet Size = Edge / Decimal Odds\n",
    "Kelly Bet Size = 0.096 / 1.91\n",
    "Kelly Bet Size = 0.0503 = 5.03%\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Translation:** Bet **5% of your total bankroll** on this bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your bankroll is $1,000 → Bet $50\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Works (The Math Behind It)\n",
    "\n",
    "Kelly Criterion balances two things:\n",
    "1. **Betting enough** to take advantage of your edge\n",
    "2. **Betting conservatively enough** to survive losing streaks\n",
    "\n",
    "If you bet Kelly size repeatedly on +EV bets, you'll:\n",
    "- Maximize your long-term bankroll growth rate\n",
    "- Have very low risk of going broke (theoretically zero if your edge calculations are perfect)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem with Full Kelly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full Kelly is aggressive.** Even with an edge, you'll experience volatility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10 bets in a row could easily go 4-6 (40% win rate) even if your true edge is 60%\n",
    "- With 5% bets, losing 6 in a row = -30% bankroll drawdown\n",
    "- This feels brutal psychologically\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fractional Kelly (Our Solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fractional Kelly = Bet a fraction of what Kelly suggests**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most professional bettors use **25% to 50% Kelly**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using 50% Kelly (Half Kelly):\n",
    "- Kelly says bet 5%\n",
    "- You actually bet 2.5%\n",
    "\n",
    "Using 25% Kelly (Quarter Kelly):\n",
    "- Kelly says bet 5%\n",
    "- You actually bet 1.25%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Fractional Kelly?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Reduces volatility** - Smaller bets = smaller swings\n",
    "2. **Protects against model errors** - If your 62% prediction is actually 58%, you're not over-betting\n",
    "3. **Psychological comfort** - Easier to stick with the system during losing streaks\n",
    "4. **Accounts for uncertainty** - We're never 100% sure of our exact edge\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Trade-off:**\n",
    "- You grow your bankroll slower than full Kelly\n",
    "- But you have much smoother growth with less risk\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real World Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have **$2,000 bankroll** and find 3 bets tonight:\n",

    "- **Total risk = $106** (only 5.3% of bankroll across all bets)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When NOT to Bet (Even with Positive EV)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many bettors set a **minimum edge threshold**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "If Edge < 5% → Skip the bet\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? \n",

    "- Transaction costs, variance not worth it for tiny edges\n",
    "- Focus on your best opportunities\n",
